# C Coding Projects

This repository contains a collection of small to medium-sized projects written in **C**, built for learning, experimentation, and hands-on practice.

The projects in this repo are for my fun and enjoyment of building coding projects in **C**. There is no particular pattern to the code, and projects. Rather, I am just testing my knowledge and having fun.

---

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to:

- Strengthen core C programming fundamentals
- Practice writing clean, modular, and maintainable code
- Explore real-world programming patterns and low-level concepts
- Build confidence through hands-on projects rather than isolated exercises

Projects may vary in scope, complexity, and focus as this repository evolves.

## Topics & Concepts Explored

Depending on the project, this repository may include work involving:

- Control flow and program structure
- Functions and modular design
- Pointers and memory management
- File I/O
- Structs
- Basic data handling and parsing
- String functions/practice
- Debugging and testing in C
- Working with the C standard library

---

## Build & Run

Most projects can be compiled using a standard C compiler such as `gcc`.

All executable files can be found in the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file.

Example:
```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 main.c -o executable_name_in_.gitignore
./program
```
*Some files include `<math.h>` and must be compiled with `-lm` at the end of the `gcc` compile line.*
